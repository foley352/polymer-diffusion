# polymer-diffusion
Matlab codes for estimating effective diffusivity and simultaneously fitting solution-immobilization diffusion models to equilibrium and dynamic data. These matlab codes are supporting information for the unpublished manuscript titled "Rigorous models for vapor diffusion in polymers with immobilization and chemical potential gradients"
